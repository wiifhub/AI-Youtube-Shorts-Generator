# Shorts Studio Upgrade Roadmap

**Published baseline:** v1.0.1 (local and remote gates passed)
**Current development branch:** `main` (v1.0.1 production release)
**Next implementation target:** v2.0.0
**Last updated:** 2026-09-25

The actionable implementation list now lives in [TODO.md](TODO.md). This
roadmap tracks release milestones and verified state; it is not a second
unordered TODO list.

---

## v1.0.1 — Security and reliability hardening

The v1.0.1 patch release carries the post-v1.0.0 security review and the
concurrency/path fixes completed on `main`.

- [x] Scrub URL credentials and session secrets from every durable job,
      backup, factory, and logging representation.
- [x] Harden loopback host handling, browser-to-loopback access, job IDs,
      update provenance, and weak-secret state mutation boundaries.
- [x] Make upload idempotency, render scratch files, clip revisions, retry
      admission, and cancellation generation-safe under concurrent requests.
- [x] Keep FFmpeg paths, waveform/preview work, and cleanup/backup media inside
      their intended ownership boundaries.
- [x] Run the full local test/lint/type/security/package smoke gates and publish
      the verified Windows and Docker artifacts from the v1.0.1 tag.
- [x] Record the v1.0.1 release evidence: 202 tests passed, 4 skipped, 68.46%
      coverage; Quality Checks `36195605900`; Docker runs `36195605940` and
      `36196233494`; and the portable payload smoke passed authenticated
      shutdown and clean exit. The installer build succeeded, but its fresh
      UAC-gated launch was not repeatable from the non-elevated release shell.
- [x] Publish the unsigned, hash-verified installer and portable ZIP. The
      installer SHA-256 is
      `69D884AC6414E255ABC467A236D13F7B41EEC686137A6949F28E0753112D08BF` and
      the portable ZIP SHA-256 is
      `2C21DDE0037339F46B4930B05A536175D7228762A6F53D5A32E7AA1D01F1D259`.

## v0.11.3 — Windows Local Runtime Hardening

The v0.11.3 follow-up contains the packaged Local runtime hardening and was
published after the release-gate evidence below.

- [x] **T-034 Packaged Local runtime completeness** — Require and collect the
      dynamically imported Whisper/CTranslate2, yt-dlp, OpenCV, and optional
      local-ranking runtime packages; report CTranslate2 in setup diagnostics;
      add a build regression test and a real packaged CPU render smoke.
- [x] Fresh authenticated packaged-runtime smoke passes for both the portable
      bundle and a fresh installer install, including CPU Local rendering.
- [x] Record the certificate-backed signing decision: the owner certificate is
      not configured, so this release is explicitly unsigned and hash-verified.
- [x] Verify the source repository is clean before tagging and publishing.
- [x] Publish v0.11.3 after the final remote CI checks are green; the stable
      GitHub release and matching Docker tag are published.

---

## Completed (v0.10.0)

- [x] Modularize `web/app.py` into route modules (`editor_routes.py`, `feature_routes.py`, `job_routes.py`, `system_routes.py`)
- [x] Add security module (`web/security.py`)
- [x] Add typed models (`web/models.py`)
- [x] Add dedicated job store (`web/job_store.py`)

- [x] Add `docker-compose.yml` with CPU/GPU profiles
- [x] Add `CHANGELOG.md`
- [x] Add API-token authentication and in-process rate limiting
- [x] Add durable jobs/checkpoints, restart recovery, SSE progress, and active
      process cancellation
- [x] Add editor, captions, multi-range editing, backup/restore metadata,
      storage, brand, cost, and publishing controls
- [x] Publish Windows installer/portable artifacts with SHA-256 checksums
- [x] Publish the public GitHub release and pass Quality Checks/Docker Publish

---

## v0.10.1 — Quality, Safety & Stability (tagged locally)

The v0.10.1 code and validation work is complete in this checkout and is
tagged locally. No push, GitHub release, asset upload, or public version switch
has been performed.

### Release gates
- [x] Complete TODO items T-001 through T-005 (cancellation, SSRF, graceful
      shutdown, bounded media work, and backup/cleanup boundaries)
- [x] Complete the implementation portions of TODO items T-010 through T-021
- [x] Add deterministic mocked local-pipeline, route, security, backup,
      shutdown, and render-smoke tests; run the Playwright creator flow
- [x] Re-run local compile, Ruff, mypy, pytest, browser, package, JavaScript,
      dependency, and pip-audit validation
- [ ] Cut the release only after a fresh authenticated packaged-runtime smoke
      test, certificate-backed signing decision, and clean repository state

### Already corrected in this area
- [x] MuAPI polling and retry limits are finite; remove the old indefinite-
      retry wording from future planning
- [x] API-token authentication and rate limiting are implemented; remaining
      work is remote-deployment hardening, not initial auth support
- [x] Local Ollama ranking, optional provider streaming, structured output,
      and configurable retries are implemented in the local provider path

---

## v0.10.2 — Frontend Refresh & Maintainability (tagged locally)

The v0.10.2 implementation is complete in this checkout and is tagged locally.
No push, GitHub release, or asset upload has been performed.

### Verified in v0.10.0
- [x] Persist dark/light/system theme and accent choices in the browser
- [x] Drag-and-drop local video upload

- [x] Add real progress bars and skeleton states for long operations
- [x] Monitor every job in a batch instead of only the first job
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts and persistent error notifications
- [x] Improve mobile layout and accessibility with automated checks
- [x] Evaluate WebSocket/pub-sub only if SSE scaling measurements justify it;
      the v0.10.2 probe supports retaining SSE (see
      `docs/performance/sse-scaling-v0.10.2.md`)

### Maintainability
- [x] Fix UTF-8 response handling at the server level (remove DOM workaround)
- [x] Split `app.js` into state, API, UI, editor, and timeline modules
- [x] Centralize the UI version and form/capability schema
- [x] Unify the SSE and polling connection manager

### v0.10.2 workflow additions

- [x] Optional generated-media backup with safe restore/relinking
- [x] Browser-local export presets
- [x] Bounded multi-level clip undo/redo with legacy one-level migration
- [x] Clear multi-cut ranges with adjacent/overlap merge guidance

---

## v0.10.3 — Security & Production Hardening (after v0.10.2)

### Already implemented
- [x] Optional API-token authentication via `.env`
- [x] In-process rate limiting on protected/public routes
- [x] Authenticated settings, update, and shutdown workflows

### Remaining hardening
- [x] Add CORS origin allowlists, CSP, and same-origin CSRF protection for
      cookie-authenticated mutations (TODO T-020)
- [x] Add login backoff/lockout, trusted-proxy validation, structured request
      logging, and broader provider-secret redaction
- [x] Add a non-disclosing `/healthz` endpoint and avoid absolute path details
      in public health responses
- [x] Replace abrupt shutdown with SIGTERM/Windows graceful drain and durable
      job-store closure (TODO T-003)
- [x] Document and implement a SQLite-backed shared limiter for same-host
      multi-process deployments; multi-host deployments use an upstream gateway
      limiter as documented in `docs/deployment/arm64-support.md`

### Deployment
- [x] Add a real local render smoke test; keep packaged Windows/Docker smoke as
      a release-gate follow-up
- [x] Verify the arm64 CPU dependency lock and publish a Linux amd64/arm64
      Buildx matrix; keep CUDA/GPU builds amd64-only
- [x] Publish a CPU Helm chart for the documented Kubernetes 1.28+ target with
      PVC, Service, optional TLS Ingress, and shared-limiter guidance

---

      portable restore/relinking (base workflow delivered in v0.10.2)
- [x] Add export presets (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts quality settings)
- [x] Add YouTube OAuth publishing foundation with PKCE, approval-first,
      private-by-default, resumable, idempotent, and scheduled uploads (T-033;
      tokens remain process-memory-only)
- [x] Add explicit merge workflow for separate highlights (multi-cut ranges
      remain available for edits inside one clip)
- [x] Expand the current one-level undo to a bounded full undo/redo history

---

## v0.11.1 — Developer Experience

### Build & Release
- [x] Add cross-platform build scripts (replace `.bat` with Python/Makefile)

## v1.0.0 — Production Ready

### v1.0.0 Beta implementation (`beta/v1.0.0`)

The implementation items below were completed on the beta branch, merged into
`main`, and released as v1.0.0. The separate `beta` prerelease channel remains
available for testing.

- [x] Add direct TikTok and Instagram Reels publishing through official APIs,
      with approval-first private defaults, OAuth state expiry, idempotency,
      and a safe manual-upload fallback.

      resumable uploads with category/privacy/scheduling controls, thumbnails,
      captions, bounded quota-aware retries, idempotency, and an audit log.
- [x] Add regression coverage for API aliases, migrations, backups, direct
      adapter mocks, variants/analytics, parallel rendering, and streaming
      Whisper progress.

### Stability
- [x] Complete API versioning (`/api/v1/`) with deprecation policy
- [x] Add comprehensive error codes and user-facing error messages
- [x] Add data migration tooling (project file format upgrades)
- [x] Add metadata backup/restore for projects and settings
- [x] Add optional media-inclusive backup/restore with versioned migrations

### Documentation
- [x] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- [x] Add user guide with screenshots for each feature
- [x] Add developer contributing guide
- [x] Add architecture decision records (ADRs) for key design choices

### Performance
- [x] Add concurrent clip rendering (parallel FFmpeg workers)
- [x] Add streaming transcription (real-time Whisper output)
- [x] Add response caching for repeated API calls
- [x] Optimize Docker image size (multi-stage build, layer caching)

### Release gates (verified; beta and production releases published)
- [x] Fresh authenticated packaged-runtime smoke test against the beta build
- [x] Certificate-backed signing decision recorded for the beta artifact
- [x] Final remote CI, hashes, and clean repository state verified before any
      production v1.0.0 tag or release (remote run `35046498312`; no
      production tag or release existed at beta-gate time)
- [x] Publish the separate beta prerelease channel at tag `beta` from the
      gated branch snapshot, with the verified ZIP, installer, and hash manifest
- [x] Main Quality Checks run `35049226780` and Docker publish run
      `35049226814` passed on `0bbf638`; the tag-triggered Docker publish run
      `35050190484` passed as well.
- [x] Fresh authenticated packaged-runtime smoke against the production build
      served UI version `1.0.0` and passed API, OAuth, error, and shutdown checks.
- [x] Record the production signing decision: the owner certificate is not
      configured, so the ZIP and installer are explicitly unsigned and
      hash-verified.
- [x] Merge the gated beta branch into `main` and publish production `v1.0.0`
      from `0bbf638` with the verified ZIP, installer, and SHA-256 manifest.

## v2.0.0 — The Vision: AI-Native Video Intelligence

### Game-changing bets

These bets define the long-term differentiation of Shorts Studio. They are
future exploration items, not commitments for v0.10.x; each needs a measured
prototype, a clear privacy boundary, and a human approval path before rollout.

- [ ] **G-001 full autonomy** — Extend the beta factory package with unattended
      scheduling, compliance checks, batch-channel processing, and policy-safe
      automation after measured production gates.
- [ ] **G-002 Creator Style Memory** — Learn approved pacing, hooks, caption
      language, framing, and brand rules across projects in an exportable local
      profile.
- [ ] **G-003 Performance Feedback Loop** — Import platform analytics, compare
      variants, and use measured retention and engagement to improve selection.
- [ ] **G-004 Multimodal Story Graph** — Index transcript, scenes, faces, OCR,
      sound events, and chapters for semantic search and selection rationale.
- [ ] **G-005 Live Stream Copilot** — Detect, transcribe, and queue reviewable
      clips while a live stream is still running.
- [ ] **G-006 Platform Distribution Mesh** — Create platform-specific variants,
      run compliance checks, schedule, and publish through auditable approvals.
- [ ] **G-007 Private Edge AI** — Make local model installation and fully offline
      processing easy enough that sensitive footage can stay on-device.
- [ ] **G-008 Collaborative Review Studio** — Add shareable review links,
      comments, approvals, roles, and version history without sharing secrets.
- [ ] **G-009 Open Extension Ecosystem** — Ship a versioned, sandboxed plugin
      SDK for pipeline stages, caption packs, exporters, and integrations.
- [ ] **G-010 production distribution** — Extend the beta YouTube adapter with
      a hosted scheduler, operational quota dashboards, live authenticated
      deployment coverage, and policy/compliance controls. Public auto-publish
      remains an explicit opt-in.

### Autonomous Clip Factory
- [ ] **Fully autonomous pipeline** — Upload a video, walk away. The system selects the best clips, applies captions, music, transitions, and branding without human intervention.
- [ ] **A/B variant generation** — Automatically produce 2-3 variants of each clip (different hooks, pacing, music) for performance testing.
- [ ] **Performance feedback loop** — Connect to YouTube/TikTok analytics to learn which clips perform best and refine future selections.
- [ ] **Batch channel processing** — Process an entire YouTube channel's backlog in one go, auto-generating shorts from every video.

### Multi-Modal Understanding
- [ ] **Scene graph analysis** — Go beyond faces: detect objects, actions, text-on-screen, and visual context to make smarter clip selections.
- [ ] **Emotion detection** — Use facial expression analysis + voice tone analysis to find genuine emotional peaks.
- [ ] **Audience engagement prediction** — Pre-score clips using engagement prediction models trained on millions of viral shorts.
- [ ] **Cross-video knowledge** — When processing a channel, learn the creator's style and apply it consistently across all shorts.

### Platform-Aware Output
- [ ] **Platform-specific optimization** — Auto-adjust caption timing, music, pacing, and aspect ratio per platform (TikTok vs Reels vs Shorts).
- [ ] **Trend-aware selection** — Monitor trending sounds, hashtags, and formats to suggest timely clip themes.
- [ ] **Optimal posting scheduler** — Analyze audience activity patterns and recommend the best time to post each clip.
- [ ] **Multi-platform batch publishing** — One click to publish the same short to YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and X simultaneously.

### Creative AI Features
- [ ] **AI-generated hooks** — Use LLMs to write multiple hook options for each clip and A/B test them.
- [ ] **Auto-caption styling** — Analyze the video's mood and automatically select the best caption style, font, and color.
- [ ] **Music recommendation** — Suggest royalty-free music that matches the clip's energy and emotional arc.
- [ ] **Thumbnail generation** — AI-select the most compelling frame and overlay text/graphics for platform thumbnails.
- [ ] **Voice cloning for intros** — Generate a branded intro voiceover in the creator's voice.

### Real-Time & Live Features
- [ ] **Live stream clipping** — Monitor a live stream and automatically clip highlight moments in real-time.
- [ ] **Real-time transcription** — Stream Whisper output as the video plays for instant preview.
- [ ] **WebSocket editor** — Collaborative real-time editing where multiple people can work on clips simultaneously.

### Enterprise & Scale
- [ ] **Multi-tenant deployment** — Run one instance serving multiple creators, each with their own workspace, billing, and API keys.
- [ ] **GPU cloud rendering** — Offload FFmpeg/Whisper to cloud GPUs for faster-than-real-time processing.
- [ ] **REST API for integrations** — Let third-party tools trigger shorts generation programmatically.
- [ ] **White-label solution** — Rebrandable version for agencies and media companies.
- [ ] **Usage billing dashboard** — Track rendering minutes, API calls, and storage per user.

### Plugin & Extension System
- [ ] **Pipeline plugins** — Custom processing stages (e.g., add intro animation, apply color grading, insert sponsor segments).
- [ ] **Caption plugins** — Community-contributed caption styles and animations.
- [ ] **Export plugins** — Custom export formats (GIF, WebM, vertical carousel for Instagram).
- [ ] **Integration plugins** — Connect to OBS, DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro for round-trip editing.

### Offline-First & Privacy
- [ ] **Fully offline mode** — Every feature works without internet using local Whisper, local LLMs, and local rendering.
- [ ] **On-device processing** — Run on a user's machine without any data leaving their network.
- [ ] **Encrypted project files** — End-to-end encrypted project files for secure collaboration.
- [ ] **GDPR compliance tools** — Automatic PII detection and redaction in transcripts and videos.

## Inline TODO Marker Inventory

The canonical backlog is [TODO.md](TODO.md). The source currently contains
**2 inline markers in 1 file**; the count below is a snapshot for cleanup
tracking, not a second backlog.

| File | Count | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| `web/static/app.js` | 2 | Encoding fix and module splitting |

---

## Notes

- **Priority:** P0 safety/recovery → P1 quality/security/release confidence → P2 UX/maintainability → P3 features
- **Release cadence:** Aim for monthly minor releases, weekly patches for critical fixes
- **Breaking changes:** Defer to v1.0.0; no API breaks before then
- **Dependency updates:** Review quarterly via `pip-audit`; pin to known-good versions and test the Starlette TestClient dependency warning
- **TODO cleanup:** Close the matching TODO.md item only after code, tests, and the relevant runtime smoke check pass; record release work in `CHANGELOG.md`
- **Related-project links:** Keep README ecosystem references current when
  importing documentation changes from maintained forks.
