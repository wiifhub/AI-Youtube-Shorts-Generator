# Shorts Studio TODO

**Published baseline:** v1.0.1 (local and remote gates passed)
**Current development branch:** `main` (v1.0.1 production release)
**Implementation target:** v2.0.0 (next production roadmap)
**Beta channel:** `beta` prerelease published from the gated branch snapshot
**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-25

This is the canonical implementation backlog. Inline `TODO` comments should
point to an item here; completed capabilities belong in `ROADMAP.md` rather
than remaining as open TODOs.

## v1.0.1 security and reliability follow-up (released)

- [x] Scrub URL credentials, signed query values, basic-auth authorities, and
  session secrets before durable writes, backups, exports, or log exposure.
- [x] Harden loopback/host checks, browser-driven loopback access, crafted IDs,
  weak-secret state mutation, and verified update-download provenance.
- [x] Make uploads, retries, render scratch files, clip revisions, and
  cancellation generation-safe under concurrent requests.
- [x] Add remediation regression coverage and publish the v1.0.1 package after
  local and remote release gates pass.
- [x] Record final v1.0.1 evidence: 202 tests passed, 4 skipped, 68.46%
  coverage; Quality Checks `36195605900`; Docker publish runs `36195605940`
  and `36196233494`; and the portable payload passed authenticated shutdown
  and clean-exit smoke. The installer compiled successfully, while its
  fresh UAC-gated launch could not be repeated from the non-elevated shell.
- [x] Publish the unsigned installer and portable ZIP with the matching
  SHA-256 manifest (`69D884AC6414E255ABC467A236D13F7B41EEC686137A6949F28E0753112D08BF`
  and `2C21DDE0037339F46B4930B05A536175D7228762A6F53D5A32E7AA1D01F1D259`).

## Documentation maintenance

- [x] Import the latest fork comparison's related-project links into `README.md`.

## v0.11.3 follow-up (released)

- [x] **T-034 Packaged Local runtime completeness** - Fixed PyInstaller
  collection of dynamically imported `faster_whisper`, `ctranslate2`,
  `yt_dlp`, OpenCV, and local-ranking SDKs; setup diagnostics now checks the
  CPU Whisper runtime; packaging coverage and a real packaged CPU render smoke
  pass. The fresh packaged smoke, certificate-backed signing decision, clean
  repository gate, remote CI, and v0.11.3 publication all pass.

## v0.10.1 completion record

- [x] **T-001 Cancellation UX and semantics** - Added queued/running Cancel
  controls, a distinct cancelled state, cancellation-aware worker admission,
  active-process termination, and API/UI regression coverage.
- [x] **T-002 SSRF and egress controls** - Added YouTube/administrator host
  allowlists, DNS answer validation for private/reserved networks, redirect
  filtering, and invalid-host/security tests.
- [x] **T-003 Graceful shutdown** - `/api/shutdown` now coordinates worker
  cancellation, persists interrupted checkpoints, closes/reopens SQLite safely,
  and signals the bound Uvicorn server; packaged smoke remains a release gate.
- [x] **T-004 Bounded media work** - Preview and waveform rendering now share
  cancellation, tracked child processes, timeouts, and a media semaphore; SSE
  polling is an async generator.
- [x] **T-005 Backup and cleanup boundaries** - Backups/export manifests redact
  media URLs, cleanup is limited to inactive job-owned caches, and archive
  validation closes its ZipFile on every explicit rejection path.

## P1 - quality, security, and release confidence

- [x] **T-010 Integration coverage** - Added deterministic mocked local-pipeline,
  security, quality, render-smoke, route, backup, and shutdown tests plus the
  Playwright creator flow (60 Python tests pass; local coverage is 49%). The
  70% ratchet remains a v0.11 quality target rather than a release blocker.
- [x] **T-011 Test-client dependency** - Validated the pinned FastAPI/Starlette
  and developer client set across the supported Python matrix; the test suite
  runs without the prior client warning.
- [x] **T-012 Provider retry reliability** - Retry counts/delays are configurable
  for OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, and MuAPI, with transient HTTP handling and
  cancellation-aware backoff/polling.
- [x] **T-013 Highlight quality controls** - Array-first JSON, duration bounds,
  chunk/overlap/dedupe controls, and clip-count limits are configurable and
  covered by tests.
- [x] **T-014 Pipeline configuration** - Added typed `PipelineConfig`, safe
  environment validation/profile selection, and shared encoding, output,
  FFmpeg, logging, and temporary-directory settings.
- [x] **T-015 Local model portability** - Added conservative hardware-aware
  Whisper selection and explicit guidance/errors for unsupported DirectML,
  ROCm, and MPS paths.
- [x] **T-016 Visual detection quality** - Added configurable Haar/DNN
  thresholds, profile cascades, invalid-mode warnings, and a detector plugin
  hook with smoothing controls.
- [x] **T-017 Clipper configuration** - Added configurable retries, caption
  presets, smoothing, encoding/audio filters, thumbnail position, output names,
  and multi-range merge tolerance.
- [x] **T-018 LLM provider ergonomics** - Added cached clients, structured JSON
  responses, optional streaming, token limits, and a local Ollama backend.
- [x] **T-020 Remote-deployment hardening** - Added explicit CORS origins, CSP,
  same-origin CSRF checks for cookie mutations, login backoff, trusted-proxy
  handling, structured request logs, broader redaction, and `/healthz`.
- [x] **T-021 Packaging reproducibility** - Centralized the version, pinned the
  GPU installer, expanded FFmpeg discovery, added a real render smoke test,
  and enabled CI SBOM/provenance generation. Authenticode signing remains an
  opt-in release operation requiring the owner's certificate.

## P2 - v0.10.2 UX and maintainability (implemented locally)

This v0.10.2 scope is implemented and tagged locally. The public release and
asset upload remain intentionally out of scope.

- [x] **T-030 Frontend modularization** - Split `web/static/app.js` into state,
  API, UI, editor, and timeline modules; fix response encoding at the server;
  add progress bars, skeletons, toasts, keyboard navigation, live status, and
  batch-job monitoring with per-source cancellation. Added a reproducible SSE
  fan-out probe; 1-250 connected clients stayed below the review thresholds,
  so WebSocket/pub-sub is not justified for this single-process milestone.
- [x] **T-031 Editing and export workflow** - Add durable project/media backup
  options, browser-local export presets, bounded multi-level undo/redo, and a
  clear multi-cut/merge workflow with removable ranges and merge guidance.
- [x] **T-032 Deployment targets** - Added a SQLite-backed shared limiter for
  same-host multi-process deployments, a verified arm64 CPU dependency lock and
  Buildx matrix, and a CPU-only Helm chart for the documented Kubernetes 1.28+
  target. Multi-node deployments still require a gateway limiter and shared
  storage with appropriate access semantics.

## P3 - feature expansion

- [x] Local Ollama backend and fully offline ranking path (LM Studio remains open)
- [x] Custom virality scoring templates, language auto-detection, and
  chapter-aware highlight hints
- [x] 16:9/4:5 validation, platform export presets, speech-aware music
  ducking, and fade/slide/zoom transitions for multi-range renders
- [x] **T-033 YouTube publishing foundation** - Added PKCE OAuth, process-memory
  token handling, approval-first plans, private-by-default/resumable uploads,
  future scheduling validation, idempotency keys, and an audit entry on upload.
- [x] Explicit merge workflow for separate local highlights
- [x] Direct publishing integrations beyond the YouTube foundation, analytics
  feedback, and A/B variants - v1 beta now includes official TikTok file
  uploads, Instagram Reels container publishing, process-memory OAuth,
  approval/idempotency controls, durable metadata variants, and explainable
  retention/engagement feedback.
- [ ] Plugin, mobile, collaboration, and cloud-rendering systems

## v1.0.0 beta production-readiness implementation

- [x] Version all API routes under `/api/v1/` while retaining a deprecated
  `/api/` compatibility surface with `Sunset` and successor `Link` headers.
- [x] Publish a stable error catalog and `{error, code}` response contract.
- [x] Add pure project migrations, startup recovery, dry-run/apply CLI tooling,
  and versioned metadata/media backup restore.
- [x] Add OpenAPI aliases, the screenshot-backed user guide, contributing
  policy, and four accepted ADRs.
- [x] Add bounded parallel FFmpeg rendering, Whisper progress streaming through
  SSE, and mutation-invalidated response caching for read-only catalogs.
- [x] **G-001 beta slice** - Add the Shorts Factory queue and reviewable package
  with clips, captions, hooks, thumbnails, metadata, platform export plans,
  and durable per-clip approval checkpoints.
- [x] **G-010 beta slice** - Add Google/YouTube PKCE sign-in, approval-first
  resumable uploads with category/privacy/scheduling controls, thumbnails,
  captions, bounded quota-aware retries, idempotency, and a credential-free
  audit log.
- [x] Before the v1.0.0 release: run a fresh authenticated packaged smoke,
  record the certificate-backed signing decision, verify remote CI/assets, and
  confirm a clean repository (remote run `35046498312`; the beta and main
  gates passed before production publication).
- [x] Production gate evidence: main Quality Checks run `35049226780`, Docker
  publish run `35049226814`, and tag-triggered Docker publish run `35050190484`
  all passed on production commit `0bbf638`.
- [x] Fresh production packaged-runtime smoke served UI version `1.0.0` and
  passed authenticated system, API-version, YouTube OAuth, error catalog, and
  shutdown/process-exit checks.
- [x] Production Windows artifacts are explicitly unsigned because the owner
  certificate is not configured; the release ZIP and installer match the
  attached SHA-256 manifest.
- [x] Publish the separate `beta` prerelease with the verified ZIP, installer,
  and SHA-256 manifest.
- [x] Merge the gated beta branch into `main` and publish production `v1.0.0`.

## Game-changing future bets (v2+)

These are deliberately larger than normal feature work. Each bet should have
a measurable creator outcome, a privacy model, and a staged prototype before
it becomes a committed release milestone.

- [ ] **G-001 full autonomy** - Extend the beta factory package with unattended
  scheduling, compliance checks, batch-channel processing, and policy-safe
  automation after measured production gates.
- [ ] **G-002 Creator Style Memory** - Learn a creator's approved pacing, hooks,
  caption language, framing, and brand rules across projects, with transparent
  controls and an exportable local profile.
- [ ] **G-003 Performance Feedback Loop** - Import platform analytics, compare
  clip variants, and use measured retention/engagement to improve future
  highlight selection and packaging instead of relying only on generic scores.
- [ ] **G-004 Multimodal Story Graph** - Index transcript, scenes, faces, OCR,
  sound events, and chapters so creators can search a video semantically and
  see why a moment was selected.
- [ ] **G-005 Live Stream Copilot** - Detect moments during a live stream,
  transcribe with low latency, and produce reviewable clips while the stream
  is still running.
- [ ] **G-006 Platform Distribution Mesh** - Generate platform-specific
  variants, run compliance checks, schedule releases, and publish through
  official APIs with an auditable approval queue.
- [ ] **G-007 Private Edge AI** - Offer a one-click offline model manager and
  fully local pipeline so sensitive footage never needs to leave the creator's
  machine or network.
- [ ] **G-008 Collaborative Review Studio** - Add shareable review links,
  comments, approvals, roles, and version history without exposing source
  media or credentials.
- [ ] **G-009 Open Extension Ecosystem** - Provide a versioned plugin SDK and
  sandbox for pipeline stages, caption packs, exporters, and integrations.
- [ ] **G-010 production distribution** - Extend the beta YouTube adapter with
  a hosted scheduler, operational quota dashboards, live authenticated
  deployment coverage, and policy/compliance controls. Public auto-publish
  remains an explicit opt-in.

## Verified complete or corrected in the v0.10.1 implementation

- Durable SQLite jobs/checkpoints with restart recovery
- SSE progress with a polling fallback
- Active-process cancellation API and route modularization
- API-token authentication and rate limiting
- Editor, captions, multi-range editing, brand/publishing controls
- Metadata backup/restore and storage controls
- MuAPI retry and polling timeouts are finite; the old "retries indefinitely"
  roadmap item is stale
- Windows installer/portable build scripts, checksums, and passing CI workflow
  definitions (the v0.10.1 release itself is intentionally not published)
- v0.10.2 frontend modules, progress/batch monitoring, keyboard/accessibility
  coverage, UTF-8 response headers, export presets, media-inclusive backup, and
  durable clip undo/redo (the v0.10.2 release itself is intentionally local)

## v0.10.3 and v0.11.0 implementation record

- [x] T-032 shared SQLite rate limits, arm64 dependency proof, multi-architecture
  CPU Docker build configuration, and documented Kubernetes/Helm packaging
- [x] User-editable virality prompt templates, Whisper language auto-detection,
  safe YouTube chapter sidecars, platform validation presets, ducking,
  transitions, explicit merge rendering, and export UI controls
- [x] T-033 approval-first YouTube OAuth foundation with PKCE, resumable chunks,
  private/scheduled defaults, idempotent approvals, and no token persistence

## v0.11.1 implementation record

- [x] Cross-platform `scripts/build.py` plus Makefile and compatibility `.bat`
  wrappers
- [x] Release Drafter workflow and beta/nightly pre-release channel workflow
- [x] Real Authenticode/codesign/notarization tooling; signing is enabled when
  the owner's certificate/Apple credentials are supplied and never faked when
  they are absent
- [x] Strict mypy configuration (Pydantic plugin) across all source modules,
  remaining optional imports moved behind dynamic adapters, Bandit CI linting,
  and a 55% coverage floor ratcheted from the 35% baseline toward 70%
- [x] Release gate: fresh Windows packaged API health, authentication, and
  shutdown smoke must pass before the GitHub release is created

## Backlog hygiene

- Keep one canonical item ID per open concern and link inline comments to it.
- Mark an item complete only after code, tests, and the relevant packaged or
  deployment smoke check pass; certificate-dependent signing and publishing are
  release-only actions.
- Do not treat a UI test that intercepts every `/api/**` request as endpoint
  integration coverage; the browser test is recorded as creator-flow coverage.
